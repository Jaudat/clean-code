# Chapter 7: Generic Programming and Templates

	IN VIDEO: Template Functions

**Generic Programming** is a programming style where algorithms are written in terms of types-to-be-specified-later which are then instansiated when needed for the specific type passed as parameter.

**C++ Templates**:
* Provides support for both functions and classes/structs
* The standard library is completely implemented as template abstractions
* They provide a specification of behavior for unspecified types
* Examples of templates: string, shared_ptr, unique_ptr, map

## Template Functions

    IN VIDEO: Template Functions

### Properties of Template functions:
* Introduced in C++11
* Arguments are of an unspecified type
* Compiler deduces their type at instantiation/Compile Time
* Function templates can be specialized for specific types. E.G. generic type vs array of generic types
* Avoid overloading template functions

### Conventions for Template Parameters:
* Convention is to use T, U, V etc. 
    * Uppercase Letters
    * Iter for Iterators
* Technically no limit to number of template parameters, but the higher the number the greater the complexity, and simplicity provides for greater flexibility and easier maintanence.
* Parameters must be unique to be deduced by the compiler

Here is an example of defining a template function:
```c++
template<typename T> //can use 'class' instead of 'typename', same thing
T add(T lhs, T rhs) {
    return lhs + rhs;
}
```

### Specialize a Function Template

Template specialization lets templates deal with special cases. It is similar to function overloading but is preferable for template functions. Here we will specialize the template function above to be used with list of ints:

```c++

// Since there is nothing between the angular brackets next to the template 
// keyword it implies that we have specified the type of arguments
template<>
List<int> add(List<int> lhs, List<int> rhs) {
    //assert lsh and rhs are same size
    List<int> result;
    for (int 1 = 0; i < lhs.size(); ++i) {
        result.add(lhs[i], rhs[i]);
    }
    return result;
} 
```

## Template Classes

### Conventions for Template Parameters:
* Convention is to use T, U, V etc. 
    * Uppercase Letters
    * Iter for Iterators
* Technically no limit to number of template parameters, but the higher the number the greater the complexity, and simplicity provides for greater flexibility and easier maintanence.
* Parameter types must be unique to be deduced by the compiler
* Template parameters do not need repeating in class definition, compiler specific

### Examples of Template Class or Struct

Basic structure of Template Class:
```c++
template<typename T>
class MyClass {
    public:
        // some code
    private: 
        // some code
    protected: 
        // some code
}
```

Basic structure of Template Struct
```c++
template<typename T>
struct MyClass {
        // some code
    private: 
        // some code
    protected: 
        // some code
}
```

### Two Styles: Compile-time Parameterization vs Member Templates

#### Compile-time parameterization

This is when the `template<typename T>` is part of the class defination. Here is an example
```c++
template<typename T>
struct GenericBuilder : public T {
    GenericBuilder(){}
    virtual ~GenericBuilder() {}

    auto build() ->
        // this is also known as ducktyping because in both the decaltype and 
        // return type we have the same statement. So "if it walks like a duck 
        // and quacks like a duck then it is likely a duck"
        decaltype(T::_build()) override {
            _adapter(*this);
            return T::_build();
        }
}
```

#### Member Templates

Member Function's Properties: 
* Class member functions are templates
* Considered a relax set of scoping rules - prevents narrowing conversions in certain cases
* Parameter names must not collide with enclosing scope
* Are deduced at compile-time, but their use aligns with run-time usage
* Member function rules apply
* Template function rules apply

Here is an example of the function:
```c++
template<typename T>
struct GenericBuilder : public T {
    // Some code

    template<typename Func>
    auto build(Func adapter) ->
        // this is also known as ducktyping because in both the decaltype and 
        // return type we have the same statement. So "if it walks like a duck 
        // and quacks like a duck then it is likely a duck"
        decaltype(T::_build()) override {
            adapter(*this);
            return T::_build();
        }
}
```

And here is it's usage 
```c++
// create an instance of adapter
MessageBuilderAdapter adapter;

// create an instance of builder
GenericBuilder<MessageBuilder> builder;

// create message using builder and adapter
Message m = builder.build(adapter);
```

### Default Template Arguments
For example we could pass default template arguments like following:
```c++
template<typename T, typename U = NullAdapter<T>>
struct GenericBuilder : public T {
    private:
        using Adapter = U;
        Adapter _adapter
    public:
        auto build() ->
            // this is also known as ducktyping because in both the decaltype and 
            // return type we have the same statement. So "if it walks like a duck 
            // and quacks like a duck then it is likely a duck"
            decaltype(T::_build()) override {
                _adapter(*this);
                return T::_build();
            }
}
```

And we can now call it in two ways: 

1. Using Default Argument 
```c++
// create an instance of builder
GenericBuilder<MessageBuilder> builder;

// create message using builder and default adapter
Message m = builder.build();
```

2. Passing another argument
```c++
// create an instance of builder
GenericBuilder<MessageBuilder, MessageBuilderAdapter> builder;

// create message using builder and adapter
Message m = builder.build();
```

A NullAdapter does nothing as it has no body. Here is an example of the NullAdapter that we used above:

```c++
template<typename T>
struct NullAdapter {
    // has a single function operator overload which takes a single arg
    void operator() (T arg) {}
}
```

## Template Specialization

Properties: 
1. Both Classes and Functions can be specialized
2. Two types of specialization:
    * Partial Specialization: Specifying specific types for one or more template parameters, but less then all of them.
    * Full Specialization: Specifying specific types for all template parameters

Here is an example of Full Specialization
```c++
template<> //Nothing between angular brackets because specified below
struct GenericBuilder : public EmailMessageBuilder {
    public: 
        EmailMessage build() override {
            _adapter(*this);
            return EmailMessageBuilder::_build();
        }

    private:
        EmailMessageBuilder _adapter;
}
```

## Defining an Empty Type

```c++
template<typename T>
struct Null; //compeletly empty struct, no body or defination
```

## Recommendation

**When designing a template, prototype for a specific type then refactor using your tests to a generic type**
