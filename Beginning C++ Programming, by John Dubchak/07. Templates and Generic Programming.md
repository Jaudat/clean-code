# Chapter 7: Generic Programming and Templates

	IN VIDEO: Template Functions

**Generic Programming** is a programming style where algorithms are written in terms of types-to-be-specified-later which are then instansiated when needed for the specific type passed as parameter.

C++ Templates:
* Provides support for both functions and classes/structs
* The standard library is completely implemented as template abstractions
* They provide a specification of behavior for unspecified types
* Examples of templates: string, shared_ptr, unique_ptr, map

## Template Functions

    IN VIDEO: Template Functions

Properties of Template functions:
* Introduced in C++11
* Arguments are of an unspecified type
* Compiler deduces their type at instantiation/Compile Time
* Function templates can be specialized for specific types. E.G. generic type vs array of generic types
* Avoid overloading template functions

Conventions for Template Parameters:
* Convention is to use T, U, V etc. 
    * Uppercase Letters
    * Iter for Iterators
* Technically no limit to number of template parameters, but the higher the number the greater the complexity, and simplicity provides for greater flexibility and easier maintanence.
* Parameters must be unique to be deduced by the compiler

Here is an example of defining a template function:
```c++
template<typename T> //can use 'class' instead of 'typename', same thing
T add(T lhs, T rhs) {
    return lhs + rhs;
}
```

## Specialize a Function Template

Template specialization lets templates deal with special cases. Here we will specialize the template function above to be used with list of ints:

```c++

// Since there is nothing between the angular brackets next to the template 
// keyword it implies that we have specified the type of arguments
template<>
List<int> add(List<int> lhs, List<int> rhs) {
    //assert lsh and rhs are same size
    List<int> result;
    for (int 1 = 0; i < lhs.size(); ++i) {
        result.add(lhs[i], rhs[i]);
    }
    return result;
} 
```
