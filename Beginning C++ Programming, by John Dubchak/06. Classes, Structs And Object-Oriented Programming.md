# Chapter 6: Classes, Structs And Object-Oriented Programming

## Structs and Classes

	IN VIDEO: Structs and Classes 

The advantage of a struct or class is when we want to group our data into a cohesive datastructure and then we can treat it as a single type.

There are 3 types of Access Specifiers or Access Privileges defined in C++:
* Public: 
    * Default for Structs
    * Visible to anyone
    * Use keyword `public`
* Private:
    * Default for Classes
    * Visible within the specific class
    * Use keyword `private`
* Protected:
    * Not visible outside
    * Visible to the class or it's subclasses
    * Use keyword `protected`

```c++
//Example of defining a struct
struct some_struct {
    public:
        //...
    private: 
        //...
    protected: 
        //...
}
```

```c++
//Example of creating a class
class some_class {
    public:
        //...
    private: 
        //...
    protected: 
        //...
}
```

Two things to note: 
* The order that the accessor specifier appear in is unimportant
* You can have multiple sections of the same access specifier e.g. having `public` appear twice in the same struct or class. This however is not recommended. It is better to have all the `public` data in one place, all the `private` in one place and all the `protected` data in one place.

We can create structs and classes with methods in the following ways:

1. All at once in .hpp file
    ```c++
    struct some_struct {
        public:
            bool is_valid(){ 
                //...
            }
        private:
            //data
    };
    ```

2. Declaration and Defination seperate in .hpp file
    ```c++
    struct some_struct {
        public:
            bool is_valid();
        private:
            //data
    };

    //Member function definations
    bool some_struct::is_valid() {
        //...
    };
    ```

3. Declaration in the .h file and Defination in the .cpp
    ```c++
    struct some_struct {
        public:
            bool is_valid();
        private:
            //data
    };
    ```

    ```c++
    #include "some_struct.h"

    //Member function definations
    bool some_struct::is_valid() {
        //...
    }
    ```

In the above code we have `::` which is called *scope resolution operator* and it tells the compiler the function is a member of the class

    IN VIDEO: Using Structs and Classes

If we want to create an instance of the above class here is a way we can do it

```c++
// In main.cpp

#include "some_struct.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    some_struct s; // new instance created
}
```

In the above struct/class we do not have members for creation, destruction, value-type copy. In an absense of a constructor, destructor and/or copy constructor the compiler will generate one. For they copy the compiler defaults to doing a memberwise copy. We can however define our own. Here is a class which has those:
```c++
// site.hpp file


class site {
    public:
        // CONSTRUCTOR without arguments setting default variables
            //one way of constructing in this case setting id to 1
        site() : id(1), random_thing(new char[id]), name("jay") {} //The  
                                        // ordering is relavent, since 
                                        // random_thing variable needs the id, 
                                        // we need to initialize id before we
                                        // use it, and therefore before 
                                        // random_thing. It is also why under 
                                        // private the id appears before 
                                        // random_thing, since it is 
                                        // constructed before too.

            // the second way to create constructor for class
        site() {
            id = 1;
            random_thing = new char[id];
            name = "jay";
            // ...
        } 

        // CONSTRUCTOR with arguments
        site(int num, std::string nam) : id(num), random_thing(new char[id]), name(nam) {}

        site(int num, std::string nam) {
            id = num;
            random_thing = new char[id];
            name = nam;
            // ...
        } 

        // DESTRUCTOR
        ~site() {
            if (random_thing) delete [] random_thing;
        }

        //GETTERS AND SETTERS
        std::string name() const { return name; } //we use const because the 
                            // function print_name defined when discussing 
                            // pass by pointer/reference/copy expects a const 
                            // as the parameter. This is what will allow the 
                            // name to be called and the name to be returned 
                            // using a const pointer, or const reference or 
                            // const value depending on how we are passing 
                            // this class
    private:


        // data
        long id;
        char* random_thing;
        std::string name;
        std::string street;
        std::string city;
        std::string state;
        std::string zip;
};

```

**Rules for Explicit Creation:**

1. Member function is called a constructor
2. Has the same name as the type
3. Does not return any value
4. Default constructor takes no arguments
5. Can acquire resources or initialize members
6. Multiples allowed called overloading
7. Duplicates not allowed (i.e. function name and its arguments are exactly the same).

**Rules for Explicit Destruction:**

1. Member function is called Destructor
2. Has the same name as the type preceded with tilde i.e. `~`
3. Does not return any value
4. Does not take arguments
5. releases resources or frees memory or frees members
6. Only a one per class definition

### Passing Structs and Classes as Arguments to Functions

#### Pass by Pointer
```c++
#include "site.h"

void print_name(const site* s) {
    if (s != nullptr) std::cout << s->name() << std::endl;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    site s;
    print_name(&s);
}   
```

#### Pass by Reference
```c++
#include "site.h"

void print_name(const site& s) {
    std::cout << s.name() << std::endl;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    site s;
    print_name(s);
}   
```

#### Pass by Copy

```c++
#include "site.h"

void print_name(const site s) { 
    // const not really needed as we are passing by value (copy) and hence
    // can modify the variable s without fear of side effects. It is being 
    // passed in a different way i.e. being put on the stack and being copied. 
    std::cout << s.name() << std::endl;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    site s;
    print_name(s);
}   
```

### Copy Constructor

**Rules for Explicit Copy Constructor:**
1. If a member function, for copy, does not exist  the compiler generates one
2. Called a default copy constructor
3. Developers can create there own copy constructor
4. The default copy constructor uses member wise copy
5. *Pass-by-Value invokes copy constructor to create copy  of the object that is passed to the function* 

Here is an example of creating an explicit copy constructor member function: 
```c++
class site {
    public: 
        site() {} //CONSTRUCTOR
        site(const site& rhs) : _name(rhs._name) {} //COPY CONSTRUCTOR
    private:
        std::string _name;
};
```

This is what a copy constructor allows us to do:

```c++
// In main.cpp

#include "site.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    site s; // new instance created

    // ...

    site s2(s); // Uses the copy constructor
}
```

### Copy Assignment

Here is an example of creating an explicit copy assignment member function using a *copy assignment operator*: 
```c++
class site {
    public: 
        site() {} //CONSTRUCTOR
        site& operator=(const site& rhs) {
            // in the conditional we are checking that we are not copying onto
            //  ourself, this is a special pointer that points to the current 
            // instance of ourself
            if (&rhs != this) {
                // copy assign members here
                _name = rhs._name;
            }
            return *this; //return dereference of this
        };
    private:
        std::string _name;
};
```

This is what a Copy Assignment allows us to do:

```c++
// In main.cpp

#include "site.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    site s; // new instance created

    // ...

    site s2 = s; // Uses the copy constructor
}
```

### Rules of thumb
In C++03 we had the following rule of thumb, called the *Rule of 3*, which states that if a class one of the following then it should define all three.

1. A destructor
2. A copy constructor
3. A copy assignment operator

In C++11 we something similar and derived from there, called the *Rule of 5*. It basically states the same thing but just adds two more. Therefore a class that defines any of the following should define all 5.

1. A destructor
2. A copy constructor
3. A copy assignment operator
4. A move constructor
5. A move assignment operator

### Inheritance
This is how we can define an *abstract supertype/base class/parent class*:
```c++

class Address {
    public:
        virtual ~Address() {} //this is a virtual destructor method
        virtual std::string to_string() const = 0; //this is the syntax of a 
                                        // pure virtual function, it has has
                                        // the 'virtual' keyword at the 
                                        // beginning and an '= 0' at the end
                                        // there also is no opening and closing
                                        //braces
}

```

NOTES:
* The presense of pure virtual functions / pure virtual methods turns the class into what is called an **abstract base class** or a **pure interface**. It is defined such because this class can not be instantiated directly. Only a sub class that implements all the pure virtual methods can be instantiated.
* In the above code example the `to_string` method will be defined by subclasses
* Since the class is an abstract base class, we should also create a virtual destructor as it will have to be derived. Virtual destructors are useful when you can delete an instance of a derived class through a pointer to base class. So for example in the following code `Base b = new Derived();` where `Derived` is a subclass of `Base`, if we then tried to disallocate memory using `delete b;`, If Base's destructor is not virtual and b is a Base* pointing to a Derived object, delete b has undefined behaviour. In most implementations, the call to the destructor will be resolved like any non-virtual code, meaning that the destructor of the base class will be called but not the one of the derived class, resulting in resources leak.To sum up, always make base classes' destructors virtual when they're meant to be manipulated polymorphically.

And here us how we can define a *child class/derived class/concrete subtype*:
```c++

class EmailAddress : public Address {
// the semi colon indicates inheritance from the parent class and is followed 
// by an inheritance access specifiers (public/private/protected)

    public: 
        virtual ~EmailAddress() {}
        std::string to_string() const override {
            // override is a keyword introdiuced in c++11 which indicates that
            // we are overriding a virtual method from the Base Class.
            return _email;
        }
    private: 
        std::string _email;
}

```

Inheritance Access Specifiers:
1. **public:** Public members of Base Class can be called by clients of the child class and used by internal members of the child class and all the child class's derived classes. Protected members of the Base Class can be used by the the internal members of the child class and all the child class's derived classes.
2. **private:** Public and Protected functions of the Base Class can only be used by internal member functions of the child class. Is also the default when no inheritance access specifier is provided.
3. **protected:** Public and Protected functions of Base Class can only be used by internal members of the child class and all the child class's derived classes.

### Dynamic Dispatch

Let us assume we have a Base Class called `Address` and two child classes called `EmailAddress` and `WebAddress`, that both inherit a `to_string` virtual method. So when we run the following code at runtime (NOT COMPILE TIME), although the `to_string` will happen on a Base Class however we will first check the **virtual function table** and then see if the Concrete Subtype has the method defination, if it does not then we go to it's Parent Class etc. This is called dynamic dispatching i.e. checking the virtual function table to get the appropriate defination at runtime.

```c++

#include <iostream>
void print_address(std::shared_ptr<Address> a) {
    std::cout << a->to_string() << std::endl;
}

std::shared_ptr<Address> s( new WebAddress("www.google.com") );
print_address(s);

s.reset( new EmailAddress("some.address@gmail.com") );
print_address(s);

```

### Polymorphism

An example of polymorphis is method overriding, so we can have multiple methods each taking in a different argument and having a different defination, for example `checkout(Visa v)`, `checkout(Mastercard m)` etc. Even though the method name is the same we can still call the 'right' method.

## Modularity and Namespaces

**Namespaces:**
* Provide a mechanism to group related functions, classes, and other functionality together
* The group exists as a name
* Members of the same namespace do not have to qualify to refer to each other
* Members outside the namespace must qualify references to members inside the namespace
* Prevents name collisions and overloading global namespace

Example of defining a namespace:
```c++
namespace ecomm {
    class Customer { ... };
    class Address { ... };
    class EmailAddress : public Address { ... };
    class WebAddress : public Address { ... };
} //NOTE: no trailing semicolon
```

And here is how we can use them using **explicit qualification**:

```c++

#include <iostream>
void print_address(std::shared_ptr<ecomm::Address> a) {
    std::cout << a->to_string() << std::endl;
}

std::shared_ptr<ecomm::Address> s( new ecomm::WebAddress("www.google.com") );
print_address(s);

s.reset( new ecom::EmailAddress("some.address@gmail.com") );
print_address(s);

```

The `::` in the above example is called the scope resolution operator and it draws out the types from the ecomm namespace.

Another way is that instead of using explicit qualification we can use **using-directive**:

```c++

#include <iostream>
using ecomm; //Pulls all the definations from the ecomm namespace into
             // the local namespace 

void print_address(std::shared_ptr<Address> a) {
    std::cout << a->to_string() << std::endl;
}

std::shared_ptr<Address> s( new WebAddress("www.google.com") );
print_address(s);

s.reset( new EmailAddress("some.address@gmail.com") );
print_address(s);

```

One feature of the language is **aliasing a namespace**: 
```c++

// These are in the global namespace and are deliberatly weirdly named to 
// prevent collisions in the global namespace
class __customer { ... };
class __address { ... };
class __emailAddress : public __address { ... };
class __webAddress : public __address { ... };

// we are creating aliases within our naming space for the proper defination 
// that point to the global defination
namespace ecomm {
    using Customer = __customer;
    using EmailAddress = __emailAddress;
    using WebAddress = __webAddress;
} //NOTE: no trailing semicolon

```
