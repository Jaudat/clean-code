## STL Organization
    IN VIDEO: STL Overview

* Containers
    - std::array
    - std::bitset
    - std::deque
    - std::forward_list
    - std::list
    - std::map (similar to dictionary in python or hashmap in Java)
    - std::queue
    - std::set
    - std::stack
    - std::unordered_map
    - std::unordered_set
    - std::vector
* Iterators
* Algorithms
* Functors (Function Objects)
* Input/Output Classes or Containers
* Multi-threading

## Containers
    IN VIDEO: STL Overview
Common operators of containers:

| Operation | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Default Constructor | Creates a default instance of the container |
| Destructor | Deletes contained elements and frees any allocated memory |
| Copy Constructor | Creates a new Instance as a copy of an existing instance |
| Copy Assignment | Creates a new Instance as a copy of an existing instance |
| Move Constructor | Creates new instance moving elements from one to the other |
| Move Assignment | Creates new instance moving elements from one to the other |

## Iterators
    IN VIDEO: STL Overview
* Objects that are used to traverse containers
* Use a common interface
* Are pure abstraction
* Implemented as both const and non-const iterators
* included from <iterator> header
* Divided into categories

| Iterator category | What it does |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| Input | Reads forward a single time |
| Output | Writes forward a single time |
| Forward | Reads forward once |
| Bidirectional | Reads both forwards and backwards once |
| Random-access | Reads with random access |

## Algorithms
    IN VIDEO: STL Overview
* Highly efficient algorithms designed for STL Containers
* Variety of algorithms reduce amount of developer code
* Include from <algorithm> header
* Divided into categories

| Category | What it does |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Non-modifying Seq. Operations | find, find_if, for_each etc. |
| Modifying Sequence Operations | comy, move, swap, transform etc. |
| Partitions | Algorithms for partitioning ranges |
| Sorting | Algorithms to support sorting |
| Binary Search | Binary search algorithms |
| Merge | Algorithms for set-like operations | 
| Heap | Algorithms to support heaps |
| Min/Max | Algorithms for min/max |
| Other | Miscellaneous algorithms |

## Function Objects (FUNCTORS)
    IN VIDEO: STL Overview
* The defination of a object that behaves like a function.
* Allows state to be stored accross calls
* Included from <functional> header
* Implements the function call operator
* Algorithms will apply the function call appropriately

We need function as a type because of the following limitation:
```c++
//A function
int AddOne(int& val) {
    return ++val;
}

// Template function defination
template<class Func>
void func_wrapper(Func fx, int val) {
    std::cout << fx(val) << endl;
}

// We wull get error because AddOne between the angular brackets is not a type 
// but is a name or more precisely a name defination
func_wrapper<AddOne>(AddOne, 123);
```


We can create types the following two ways
* C-Style Function Pointers
```c++
// Given the following function prototype or signature
int AddOne(int&);

// There are two ways to do this using c-style function pointers
// 1.
using AOP1 = int(*)(int&); //Notice the similarities with the method signature
func_wrapper<AOP1>(AddOne, 123); 
// 2.
typedef int(*AOP2)(int&); //Notice the similarities with the method signature
func_wrapper<AOP2>(AddOne, 123);
```

* Idiomatic Type Safe C++ 
```c++
// Given the following function prototype or signature
int AddOne(int&);

// Here is the basic function pointer syntax using idiomatic C++
using Fx = std::function<int(int&)>; //represents the defination of any 
                                     // callable or in this case the 
                                     // defination of a function as a function

func_wrapper<Fx>(AddOne, 123);
```

### Captures
Used in Lambdas:
e.g. 
```c++
constexpr auto AddOne = [&](int& i) {
    return ++i;
}
```

| Capture | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `[]` | Do not capture anything |
| `[=]` | Capture local names by value |
| `[&]` | Capture local names by reference |
| `[this]` | Capture the `this` pointer |
| `[=x] |` Capture `x` by value |
| `[&x] |` Capture `x` by reference
