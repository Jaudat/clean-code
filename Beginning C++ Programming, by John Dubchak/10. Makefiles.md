# Chapter 10: Makefiles

    IN VIDEO: Anatomy of a Makefile

* Makefiles are a template for compiling and linking
* Confusing for newcomers
* Keep them simple
* Use one whenever your compile becomes nontrivial
* Remember: tabs not spaces are used in your makefile 

## Creating Makefiles

* GCC Implicit Variables

    | GCC Implicit Flags | Descriptions |
    | ------------------ | ------------ |
    | CC | Name of C compiler, "gcc" by default |
    | CXX | Name of C++ compiler, "g++" by default |
    | CFLAGS | Additional flags passed to C compiler |
    | CPPFLAGS | Additional flags passed to C preprocessor |
    | CXXFLAGS | Additional flags passed to C++ compiler |
    | LDFLAGS | Additional flags passed to the linker |
    | LDLIBS | Library flags or names passed to linker |

* Path and Variable Declarations
    ```make
    INC = -I . -I ../include
    LDLIBS = 
    LDFLAGS = 
    CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11
    BIN_NAME = <program name>

    BUILD_DIR = ./build
    # Sources files where we created a wildcard for all .cpp files
    SRCS = $(wildcard *.cpp)
    # intermediate files for all of our cpp files that get turned to .o files
    OBJ = $(SRCS:%.cpp=$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o) 
    # dependecies created from .o files that are automatically generated into # .d files in the next section
    DEPS = $(OBJ:%.o=%.d)
    ```

* Build Rules, Commands, Dependency Chains
    ```make
    # Works recursively by checking if a target is built if not then builds it

    # BIN_NAME is a target that depends on a BUILD_DIR directory and a 
    # BIN_NAME files existing, if that does not exist then target gets rebuilt
    $(BIN_NAME) : $(BUILD_DIR)/$(BIN_NAME)

    # BUILD_DIR/BIN_NAME depends on the OBJ files, if OBJ files do not exist 
    # then those gets rebuilt
    $(BUILD_DIR)/$(BIN_NAME) : $(OBJ)
        # rules for building the target
        mkdir -p $(@D) # means make the directory for BUILD_DIR
        $(CXX)$(CXXFLAGS) $^ -o $@ $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS) # invoking the c++ 
                                                        # compiler, passing 
                                                        # all the c++ flags to 
                                                        # it and then creating 
                                                        # an output file of 
                                                        # BIN_NAME inside the 
                                                        # BUILD_DIR using the 
                                                        # LD_FLAGS and the 
                                                        # LD_LIBS based on the 
                                                        # first target which 
                                                        # comes from OBJ

    -include $(DEPS) # include line which signals to the dependency manager
                     # built into the GCC that will take care of generating
                     # dependencies, related to -MMD in the line below which 
                     # means guarentee that my dependencies are up to date, 
                     # these will be generated for us

    S(BUILD_DIR)/%.o : %.cpp
        mkdir -p $(@D)
        $(CXX) -static $(CXXFLAGS) -MMD -c $< -o $@ $(INC)
    ```

* Targets 
    ```make
    # means declare all of my targets i.e. all, clean and tests
    .PHONY: all clean tests

    # depends upon clean and BIN_NAME, so we invoke 'make all', it will run 
    # clean which just removes the build directory and then runs the BIN_NAME 
    # which will generate the application by recursively building the targets
    # it depends upon
    all: clean $(BIN_NAME)
    
    # depends upon nothing 
    clean: 
        rm -fr $(BUILD_DIR)

    # Again depends upon BIN_NAME like above, when target is built it simply
    # runs the executable in BUILD_DIR/BIN_NAME
    tests: $(BIN_NAME)
        $(BUILD_DIR)/$(BIN_NAME)
    ```

## Using Makefiles

```bash
# Regular makefile (named either makefile or Makefile) in the same directory 
# can be run as follows
make clean tests

# If make file is named differently or is another directory we run it like this
# e.g. GCC 5.2.0 with C++14
make -f makefile.gcc52_14 clean tests
```
