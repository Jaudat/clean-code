## Using Correct Types And Const
    IN VIDEO: Use the Correct Types and Const as much as possible

Here is an example code:
```c++
int main() {
    std::vector<int> v{ 1,2,3,4 };
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i=0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
        sum += v[i]; //we are limiting ourselves to ~2^31
    }
}
```

Therefore we can use unsigned int to increase the range:
```c++
int main() {
    std::vector<int> v{ 1,2,3,4 };
    int sum = 0;
    for (unsigned i=0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
        sum += v[i]; //now we can go upto ~2^32
    }
}
```

However there are still the following problems:
* The actual type of std::vector<int>::size() is std::vector<int>::size_type
* This tends to be `size_t`, or an unsigned 64-bit int on most 64-bit machines
* If you use the wrong type you are artificially limiting your range and potentially adding conversion overhead.
* This can become a real issue with algorithm correctness on modern systems with large memory

Therefore this is the preferable version of the above code:
```c++
int main() {
    std::vector<int> v{ 1,2,3,4 };
    int sum = 0;
    for (size_t i=0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
        sum += v[i]; 
    }
}
```

Another thing to note is to use `const` as much as possible, this is because we get the following benefit from it: 
* Helps you and future readers of the code reason about it
* The compiler enforces the const for us.

Here is the example code using a `const`:
```c++
int main() {
    const std::vector<int> v{ 1,2,3,4 }; //As v won't change in the func body
    int sum = 0;
    for (size_t i=0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
        sum += v[i]; //now we can go upto ~2^32
    }
}
```

**NOTE: To use correct types we should try to use `auto` as much as possible to reduce code that relies on specific types**

**NOTE: Use tools as much as possible as modern compilers can warn us of type mismatches with the appropriate warnings enabled.**

## Tools
    IN VIDEO: Use the Tools Available

### Source Control
* tools like git bisect can help track down bugs by figuring out which code change gave us the bug
* Source control gives you the confidence to refactor
* git, mercurial, perforce, cvs, subversion, rational team concert,

### Compiler
* modern compilers do a complex analysis of source code
* turn the warnings up as high as possible
    - Visual C (MSVC):
        + /W4 (/Wall not recommended)
    - CLang and GCC:
        + -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor
        + -Wold-style-cast -Wcast-align -Wunused
        + -Woverloaded-virtual -pedantic
    - Clang:
        + Can also consider -Weverything -Wno-c++98-compat

### Static Analyzers
* Perform an analysis of source code without actually executing the code
* Includes the sophisticated analysis and warnings that modern compilers perform
* They include:
    - cppcheck
    - MSVC
    - clang
        + -format
        + -check
        + -tidy
    - metrix++
    - ... and more
    - 

### Runtime Analyzers
* They are executed alongside the programs execution
* They include:
    - Sanitizers: (Built into recent versions of GCC and CLang)
        + Address
        + Thread
        + Memory
        + UndefinedBehavior
        + Leak
    - Valgrind (Runs code through a virtual CPU and can detect many of the same errors as the runtime sanitizers)
    - Checked STL implementation (Verifies correct usage of STL) / electric fence (Libarary replacement for cmemory, allocate and free functions and can detect when doing invalid memory accesses)

### Automated Testing
* Ensure that code is behaving as expected
* Confidence to refactor and clean up code
* If you are starting with an existing code base, add automated testing before you apply these practices
* Tools: 
    - Catch from Phil Nash
    - Google test (gtest)
    - Boost.Test

### Continious Integration
* Checks each commit against a set of compilers and tools
* A necessity for maintaining code quality
* Commercial Hosting (free for open source)
    - Travis CI for Linux/MacOs
    - Appveyor for Windows (Builds against MinGW and Visual Studio)
    - ...
* Private Hosting
    - Jenkins
    - Hudson
    - ...

###  Fuzzy Testing
* Attempts to generate new/novel tests for your code
* Works primarily with projects that accept input files
* 'Breeds' new inputs by analyzing code paths

## Optimization
    IN VIDEO: A Note about Optimization

According to Donald Knuth (1974 Turing Award Lecture), "Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or atleast most of it) in programming". Also in C++ Core Guidelines (PER.1). However this does not mean that we do not optimize at all. There is this concept by Sutter and Alexandrescu in *C++ Coding Standards* of "Don't Pessimize Prematurely". What they mean by this is that we should make design decisions such that we avoid copies and avoid common optimiization problems without going out of our way to optimize code.
We should consider performance because:
* Why use C++ in project if not for performance considerations
* Idiomatic C++ is more optimizable by the compiler, as the compiler writers put a lot of effort on optimizing common coding patterns.
* Simpler code is often compiled to smaller binaries, which leaves more room for data.

### Performance Anti-Patterns
This is when the coder will do something thinking they are making the code better performing by helping the compiler but instead are hurting performance.

e.g. 
```c++
// OLD C++98 Code
std::string get_a_string() {
    std::string a = "bob";
    return a;
}

int main() {
    return get_a_string().size(); //Optimized by the compiler, so in assembly
                                  // language the value is hardcoded to 3 and 
                                  // the get_a_string funtion isn't even called
}
```

```c++
// NEW C++11 Code
// New developer may think he can help the compiler here by take advantage of 
// move semantics to move the result out of get_a_string so that the main 
// function can use it while avoiding string copy

std::string get_a_string() {
    std::string a = "bob";
    return std::move(a); 
}

int main() {
    return get_a_string().size(); // Compiler no longer able to perform the
                                  // same optimization as above. Therefore it // must actuall call the get_a_string 
                                  // function, slowing performnce 
}
```

**NOTE: We can see this by using an interactive compiler like the one in GCC.GODBOLT.ORG**

* Using std::move forces the compiler to perform a move operation which subverts the optimization called "Return Value Optimization".
* Without std::move, the return value is inlined directly in main
* With std::move, no inlining occurs, compiled code is 2.5x longer and atleast 10% slower in tests.

## C++ Core Guildlines
    IN VIDEO: What are the C++ Core Guidelines

"This is a set of core guidelines for modern C++, C++14, and taking likely future enhancements and taking ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account. the aim is to help C++ programmers to write simpler, more efficient, more maintainable code"
                                                    - C++ Core Guidelines (IN)

* Created and Edited by Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter
* Initial focus was on safety
*  100's of items
*  100's of sections in those items that still need to be fleshed out

### Enforcement
* Many rules have enforcement guidelines
* They are intended for static analysis tools
* Existing rule checkers
