# Chapter 4: Resource Management

## IN VIDEO: In interfaces, use raw pointers to denote single (optional) objects only (R.2 in CppCoreGuidelines)

* Pointers in Interfaces 
    - should only be used to represent a single item.
    - Advisable to use only for single **optional** item.
* Consider using Guideline Support Library `span` class. this class helps us to interact with older pointer based interfaces like in old C code, by implementing a begin pointer and end pointer.
* Consider using `optional` for optional parameters, instead of pointer. Found in Boost library and is also under discussion to be added to the C++ Standard
* Use available tools to check such as C++ Core Checker. Which may find suspicious pointer accesses and pointer arithematic inside of functions. Which may alert us that we are doing unchecked unbounded operations on our pointers.

The following code works and generates no warning for any compilers, but it is a BAD IDEA.
```c++
//Because we manually need to insert the count, so we have a limit to loop to. 
//When the count that we manually inserted is wrong we may get BufferOverrun.
void print_ints(const int *s, int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        std::cout << s[i] << '\n';
    }
}

int main() {
    const int ints[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
    print_ints(ints,5)
}
```

The following is an even WORSE IDEA:
```c++
//We will get an infinate loop if the last element isn't a 0 in this case.
void print_ints(const int *s) {
    for (; *s != 0; ++s) {
        std::cout << *s << '\n';
    }
}

int main() {
    const int ints[] = {1,2,3,4,5,0};
    print_ints(ints)
}
```

Using a vector container is a better idea in cases like this:
```c++
void print_ints(const vector<int> &t_ints) {
    for (const auto i : t_ints) {
        std::cout << i << '\n';
    }
}
int main() {
    print_ints({1,2,3,4,5});
}
```


Here is an examples where we can use Pointers in Interfaces (optional single object):
s
```c++
void use_string(const std::string *t_s) {
    // the argument may optionally be a null string
    if (t_s) {
        //do something
    }
}

int main() {
    std::string s("hello world");
    use_string(&s);
}
```

But if the single object is not optional then it is better to use references for the interfaces. This allows the compiler to check the behavior for us so we know that we are doing something that is expected behavior for the interface. For Example:

```c++
void use_string(const std::string &t_s) {
    //do something
}

int main() {
    use_string("hello world");
}
```

## IN VIDEO: Manage resources automatically using Resource Handles and RAII (R.1 in CppCoreGuidelines)

**RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):** Is the idea that if you create an object that needs to acquire a resource that by the time that object is done constructing it will be fully constructed with all resources necessary acquired and when it is destructed it will properly clean itself up.

Properties of RAII:
* Uses constructor/destructor pairs to make sure anything that was allocated & initialized is also deallocated/uninitialized as necessary
* Eliminates the possibility that an unexpected code path could prevent cleanup
* Can actually be more efficient
* Safer and more maintainable code

E.g. 0402_non_raii_example.cpp
```c++
#include <string>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int read_from_fifo(const std::string &t_fifo_name)
{
  const auto flags = O_RDONLY;
  const auto mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR;

  const auto fid = [&](){
    if (::mkfifo(t_fifo_name.c_str(), mode) != 0) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Unable to mkfifo: " + t_fifo_name);
    }
    const auto fid = ::open(t_fifo_name.c_str(), flags, mode);
    if (fid == -1) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Unable to open fifo: " + t_fifo_name);
    } else {
      return fid;
    }
  }();

  size_t bytes_read = 0;
  while (bytes_read < 1024) {
    std::vector<uint8_t> buff(256, 0);
    const auto bytes = read(fid, &buff.front(), buff.size());
    if (bytes < 0) {
      close(fid); // good thing we remembered to close this
      throw std::runtime_error("Error reading from fifo!");
    }
    bytes_read += bytes;
  }

  close(fid); // and here
  return bytes_read;
}

int main()
{
  try {
    std::cout << "total bytes read: " << read_from_fifo("/home/jason/fifo") << '\n';
  } catch (const std::exception &e) {
    std::cout << "exception while reading from fifo: " << e.what() << '\n';
  }
}
```

0402_raii_example.cpp
```c++
#include <string>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Fifo
{
  static int openfifo(const std::string &t_fname, int flags, mode_t t_mode) {
    if (::mkfifo(t_fname.c_str(), t_mode) != 0) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Unable to mkfifo: " + t_fname);
    }
    const auto fid = ::open(t_fname.c_str(), flags, t_mode);
    if (fid == -1) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Unable to open fifo: " + t_fname);
    } else {
      return fid;
    }
  }

  public:
  Fifo(const std::string &t_fname, int t_flags, mode_t t_mode)
    : m_fileid(openfifo(t_fname, t_flags, t_mode)) {
      // fileid successfully initialized
    }

  ~Fifo() {
    ::close(m_fileid); //Only need to close once, when object destructed
  }

  int fileid() const {
    return m_fileid;
  }

  private:
  int m_fileid;
};

int read_from_fifo(const std::string &t_fifo_name)
{
  Fifo f(t_fifo_name, O_RDONLY, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);

  size_t bytes_read = 0;

  while (bytes_read < 1024) {
    std::vector<uint8_t> buff(256, 0);
    const auto bytes = read(f.fileid(), &buff.front(), buff.size());
    if (bytes < 0) {
      throw std::runtime_error("Error reading from fifo!");
    }
    bytes_read += bytes;
  }

  return bytes_read;
}

int main()
{
  try {
    std::cout << "total bytes read: " << read_from_fifo("/home/jason/fifo") << '\n';
  } catch (const std::exception &e) {
    std::cout << "exception while reading from fifo: " << e.what() << '\n';
  }
}
```

## IN VIDEO: Avoid defining any default operations, or define them all (C.20, C.21 in CppCoreGuidelines)

**Special Member functions** (These are the default operations):
* Default constructor   `Type();`
- Copy constructor      `Type(const Type &);`
- Move constructor      `Type(Type &&);`
- Copy assignment       `Type &operator=(const Type &);`
- Move assignment       `Type &operator=(Type &&);`
- destructor            `~Type();`

These functions can interact with each other and can be generated automatically for us by the compiler. But by defining some of them (All except the default constructor) manually we may inadvertently prevent the compiler from generating others. Especially in the case of the move constructor and move assignment the failure to generate these by the compiler may not produce any warnings and may be silent. This may lead to inefficient code as copies will need to occur where moves could have occured instead.

**The Rule of 0**:
* Never define any of the special functions (although default constructor not generally included in this list)
* With class initializers available in C++11 this can even include the default constructor
* Likely will result in less code and smaller / more efficient compiled code.

Although there are exceptions to this rule, IE:
* If you must manage a resource, you must have constructors/destructors and utilize RAII
* If you manage a resource, define, =default or =delete all of the special functions (I.E. Either apply the Rule of 0, or apply the Rule of 5)
* If you manage a resource, manage exactly one resource.

Here is an example of applying the rule of 0:
```c++
struct Int {
    Int (int i) : ptr(new int(i)){} //created constructor
    Int() : ptr(new int(0)) {} //created constructor
    Int(const Int &) = delete;
    Int(Int &&) = delete;
    Int& operator=(const Int &) = delete;
    Int& operator=(Int &&) = delete;
    ~Int() { delete ptr; }
    int *ptr;
}
```


## IN VIDEO: Prefer Stack Objects (over objects on heap) (R.5 in CppCoreGuidelines)

Heap objects are the ones that are dynamically created. Like the following example: 
```c++
int main() {
    // created with new statement
    string *p = new string("hello world");
    // So some work. But if an exception occurs the next line won't be executed
    // therefore we will have a memory leak because p won't be deallocated
    delete p;
}
```

The following example is better because `make_unique` will create a unique_ptr which takes advantage of RAII to make sure the objects lifecycle is properly managed.

```c++
int main() {
    const auto p = make_unique<string>("hello world");
    // Do some work
}
```

But the best thing to do is make the string reside in the stack.
```c++
int main() {
    std::string s("hello world");
    // Do some work.
}
```

Stack based objects are:
* More efficient, as they do not perform dynamic allocation, instead memory is allocated by the compiler ahead of time since it knows the size of objects that will live on the stack. Also dynamic allocation may incur a lock during the memory allocation phase which can significantly slow down mutithreaded applications.
* Help the compiler optimize because it can reason about the lifetime of objects and it can more efficiently access objects that are on the stack. 
* Less code/safer/utilize RAII.

E.g. 0404_heap_based.cpp
```c++
#include <vector>
#include <memory>

struct Base {
  // Since parent class of Derived and Derived2, therefore need 
  // to create constructor and destructor using virtual keyword
  virtual int do_something() = 0;
  virtual ~Base() = default;
  // Since we created a destructor we will follow Rule of 5
  // and create rest of the special functions
  Base() = default;
  Base(Base &&) = default;
  Base(const Base &) = default;
  Base& operator=(Base &&) = default;
  Base& operator=(const Base &) = default;
};

struct Derived : Base {
  virtual int do_something() override {
    return value++;
  }
  int value = 0;
};

struct Derived2 : Base {
  virtual int do_something() override {
    return value += 2;
  }
  int value = 5;
};

int main()
{
  std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Base>> objs;

  for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
    objs.push_back(std::make_shared<Derived>());
    objs.push_back(std::make_shared<Derived2>());
  }

  for(const auto &o : objs) {
    o->do_something();
  }
}

/* The above code has the following disadvantages:
  * It is doing a virtual call on do_something() 
  * It is having a layer of indirection because of the shared pointer
  * It is having to do heap allocation
  * It is having to move shared pointers which isn't as efficient as it could 
    be.
*/
```

E.g.0404_stacjk_based.cpp
```c++
#include <vector>
#include <memory>


struct Derived {
  int do_something() {
    return value++;
  }
  int value = 0;
};

struct Derived2 {
  int do_something() {
    return value += 2;
  }
  int value = 5;
};

int main()
{
  std::vector<Derived> objs1;
  std::vector<Derived2> objs2;

  for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
    objs1.emplace_back();
    objs2.emplace_back();
  }

  const auto do_something = [](auto &vec){
    for(auto &o : vec) {
      o.do_something();
    }    
  };

  do_something(objs1);
  do_something(objs2);
}
/* This solution is much more simpler becuase
  * We do not need to ave a base class
  * We do not have to have dynamic allocation.
  * We do not have to have virtual function calls
  * We do not have to concern ourselves with applying Rule of 5
*/
```

* Prefer Scope Managed objects.
* Prefer Stack based objects.
* Use tools available like *heap profilers*.
