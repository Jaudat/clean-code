## IN VIDEO: Variable Scopes and Initialization (ES.5, ES.20, ES.21, ES.22 in CppCoreGuidelines)

* Smallest code possible is not necessarily the goal.
* Never create a variable until you can initialize it.
* Limit the scope of variables as much as possible.
* Use const whenever possible.
* With each pass of simplification, look for additional simplifications
* Use the tools available - some static notifiers can notify you when variable scope can be reduced.

Here is an example of some "bad" code:
```c++
int main() {
    size_t num_rs, total_length;
    std::vector<std::string> postfixes;
    std::string s1, appended;

    s1 = "Some rather long string";
    num_rs = std::count(std::begin(s1), std::end(s1), 'r');
    postfixes = {"1", "22", "333"};
    total_length = 0;

    for (const auto& postfix : postfixes) {
        appended = s1 + postfix;
        total_length += appended.size();
    }
    return num_rs + total_length;
}
```

Here is the same code optimized:
```c++
    const std::string s1 = "Some rather long string";
    const auto num_rs = std::count(std::begin(s1), std::end(s1), 'r');
    const std::vector<std::string> postfixes = {"1", "22", "333"};

    int total_length = 0;
    for (const auto& postfix : postfixes) {
        const auto appended = s1 + postfix;
        total_length += appended.size();
    }
    return num_rs + total_length;
```

Some of this code's advantages compared to the previous versions are:
* 13 statements reduced to 8.
* Compile size reduced by about 1/3.

But we can go even further. Here is the same code with more advanced initialization cleanup:
```c++
    const std::string s1 = "Some rather long string";
    const auto num_rs = std::count(std::begin(s1), std::end(s1), 'r');

    int total_length = 0;
    for (const auto& postfix : {"1", "22", "333"}) {
        const auto appended = s1 + postfix;
        total_length += appended.size();
    }
    return num_rs + total_length;
```

Now we have accrued even more benefits, such as:
* An additional 50% compile size reduction (down to 1/3 the original size)
* Additional statement removed , source is 1/2 size of original.

## IN VIDEO: Properly Initialize Member Variables (C.47, C.48, C.49 in CppCoreGuidelines)

### Member Initializer List

The following constructor is not ideal because it must first construct the object `s` and then assign it the value that was passed in the constructors argument list.

```c++
struct R_Counter {
    R_Counter (std::string t_s) {
        s = std::move(t_s);
        num_rs = std::count(s.begin(), s.end(), 'r');
    }

    std::string s;
    int num_rs;
}
```

Instead a member initializer list should have been used. They have the following properties:
* Called before the constructor body begins, and after any base class initializers
* Has the format: `constructor-initializer : mem-initializer-list`
    ```c++
    ClassName(const int i, std::string t_s) 
        : BaseClass(i),
        m_s(std::move(t_s)) {}
    ```
* **Member initializer lists are the only way to initialize `const` and reference objects.** This is because they are constructed and then made `const`. If instead we tried to assign a value to `const` in the body of the constructor the compiler won't let us. This is because the variable would already have been constructed as `const` and the compiler won't let us reassign their values.
* In the example code above it will save us the construction of `s` and assignment operation, instead `s` will be constructed with the appropriate value.

Therefore the above example code with member initializer list ends up like this:

```c++
// This code is wrong because Members are initialized in the order they are 
// declared, not in the order they are called in the initializer list. In the 
// above example the value of t_s would have already been moved to s, 
// therefore when we call std::count it will actually return 0 because t_s no 
// longer contains anything.
struct R_Counter {
    R_Counter (std::string t_s) 
        : num_rs(std::count(t_s.begin(), t_s.end(), 'r')), 
        s(std::move(t_s)) { }

    const std::string s;
    const int num_rs;
}

// Therefore the correct way to write the struct is as follows:
struct R_Counter {
    R_Counter (std::string t_s) 
        : s(std::move(t_s)), 
        num_rs(std::count(s.begin(), s.end(), 'r')) { }

    const std::string s;
    const int num_rs;
}
```

CLang and GCC warn us about intialization order (but not MSVC).

### Prefer In-Class Initializers

**We should prefer in-class initializers instead of member initializer list for default or constant values.** So Instead of doing:
```c++
struct Tool {
    Tool() : call_count(0) {}

    void call() {
        ++call_count;
    }
    int call_count;
}
```

we should do:
```c++
struct Tool {
    Tool() {}

    void call() {
        ++call_count;
    }
    int call_count = 0;
}
```

## IN VIDEO: Use Lambdas for complex intialization, especially of `const` variables

* Sometimes objects take multiple steps to initialize or multiple decisions need to be made 
* These considerations can get in the way of best practices such as never declaring a variable until we are ready to give it a meaningful value.
* Objects cannot be initialize when declared
* const cannot be used
* In cases duch as above we should use lambdas.
    - C++ Lambda expressions can be used to simplify complex initialization.
    - They can be used to create more const-correct code
    - They may have better performance by reducing object construction/assignment
    - They may be controversial due to C++ developers not being used to seeing this construct

Here is some example code:
```c++
// This code suffers form the fact that s1 should be const, we also have to 
// declare it and then reasign the value
int main(int argc, const char *[]) {
    std::string s1;
    switch (argc) {
        case 0: s1 = "0 Arguments"; break;
        case 1: s1 = "1 Arguments"; break;
        default: s1 = "Many Arguments";
    }
    return s1.size();
}

// There are multiple approaches we can take to solve these problems.

// One of them is to breakout the functionality in a seperate function. 
// Although this may introduce function definations that we only use once, 
// thereby cluttering the codebase.
std::string count_args(const int argc) {
    switch (argc) {
        case 0: return "0 Arguments";
        case 1: return "1 Arguments";
        default: return "Many Arguments";
    }
}

int main(int argc, const char *[]) {
    const std::string s1 = count_args(argc);
    return s1.size();
}

// Another way is to make use of ternary operators. Although this can get 
// difficult to read if there are too many cases.
int main(int argc, const char *[]) {
    const std::string s1 = 
        argc == 0 ? "0 Arguments" :
            (argc == 1 ? "1 Arguments": "Many Arguments");
    return s1.size();
}

// The most preferable way however is to use C++11 lambda expressions.
int main(int argc, const char *[]) {

    // Similar in use to immediately invoked function expression or iffy as is 
    // often seen in javascript
    std::string s1 = [&]() { // declaring the lambda using [&]()
                             // indicating we want to capture all local values 
                             // by reference
        switch (argc) {
            case 0: return "0 Arguments";
            case 1: return "1 Arguments";
            default: return "Many Arguments";
        }
    }(); //Braces at the end to immediately invoke this lambda

    return s1.size();
}
```

The final way is prefered because it avoids new single use functions that have no other reason to exist in the codebase. And declares to the user exactly what we are doing for these simple statements, once we get used to the syntax. We can also use lambdas to initialize complex objects that have multiple steps. 

```c++
int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec(25, 0);
    vec[10] = 18;

    return vec[10];
}

// The following is more verbose then the original but it still allows us in 
// the scope of main to declare a variable const, take advantage of auto and 
// declare our intent to the compiler and the future reader of the code that 
// this value of the vector is constant and that the rest of the code , i.e. 
// v[10]=18, is merely intialization and should not detract from our reading 
// of the rest of the logic of this function
int main() {
    const auto vec = []() {
        std::vector<int> v(25, 0);
        v[10] = 18;
        return v;
    }

    return vec[10];
}
```
