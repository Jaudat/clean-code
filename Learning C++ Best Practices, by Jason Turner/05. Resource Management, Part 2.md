## IN VIDEO: Don't Use MALLOC and FREE (R.10 in CppCoreGuidelines)

We should not use `malloc` and `free` for the following reasons:
* `malloc` does not initialize an object it only frees enough memory to hold the object
* `free` doesn't call destructors
* `malloc`/`free` and `new`/`delete` don't mix. And it is preferable to use `new`/`delete`.

```c++
struct MyClass() {
    std::string s = "Hello World";
}

int main() {
    void *p = malloc(sizeof(MyClass));

    // What if malloc returns null?

    MyClass *o = new (p) MyClass(); //Have to use (Placement new), because by 
                                    //default object constructor is not called

    // What if MyClass throws an exception?

    o->~MyClass(); //Have to use this, because by default object destructor 
                    //not called

    // What if the destructor i.e. ~MyClass() throws an exception

    free(p);

    //Therefore we should avoid using malloc and free
}
```

## IN VIDEO: Avoid NEW and DELETE (R.11 in CppCoreGuidelines)

`new`/`delete`:
* Are better than `malloc` and `free`.
* Properly construct / destruct objects

However they are not perfect, we will get a memory leak int he following case:

```c++
struct MyClass() {
    std::string s = "Hello World";
}

int main() {
    MyClass *o = new MyClass();
    //do work....what if function exits in unexpected way?

    delete o;
}
```


In the example bellow, what will happen if `do_something_else` throws an exception. It is completly up to the compiler what order the arguments are evaluated. It may be the case that `new std::string("hello")` is called first, in which case the memory for the object has been allocated, and then `do_something_else` throws an exception, and `delete_ptr` is never called, and we leak a string object.

```c++
void delete_ptr(std::string *p, int) {
    delete p;
}

void dosomething() {
    delete_ptr(new std::string("hello"), do_something_else());
}
```

We will fix that error here, but a memory leak may still occur. Because the compiler is free to reorder the arguments, it is possible that the compiler chooses to first construct `new string("hello")` and then call `do_something_else` which will throw an exception, so we will never get to the `unique_ptr(...)` and the `use_ptr(...)` calls. In a case like this the `new string(...)` object will be leaked again. 

```c++
void use_ptr(const unique_ptr<string> &p, int) {
    // do something with p
}

void dosomething() {
    use_ptr( unique_ptr(new string("hello")), do_something_else() );
}
```

So will use the `make_unique` function found in c++14 instead, which constructs the object for us and returns a unique pointer. So although the compiler is free to reorder statements it must complete the call to `make_unique`. So now if either `make_unique` or `do_something_else` were to throw an exception, none of those two function calls would be interrupted by the other and we are gauranteed that the string resource will be properly handled by the stack.

```c++
void use_ptr(const unique_ptr<string> &p, int) {
    // do something with p
}

void dosomething() {
    use_ptr( make_unique<string>("hello"), do_something_else() );
}
```

Therefore we should try to:
* Avoid `new` and `delete` if possible.
* Prefer RAII/scoped pointers
* Use `std::make_unique<>` (C++14) and `std::make_shared<>` (C++11) instead.
* The `std::make_shared<>` is more efficient, then manually constructing an object and then passing it to a shared pointer constructor because it is able to collapse what would be two allocations down into one. 
* Use tools available: ReSharper C++ from JetBrains
* Further reading: Effective Modern C++ by Scott Meyers

## IN VIDEO: Use unique_ptr Or shared_ptr correctly (R.20, R.21, R.22 in CppCoreGuidelines)

`unique_ptr` should be used to:
* Represent single ownership
* Has 0 overhead compared to manual heap memory management such as calling `new` or `delete` yourself. While providing the advantage of automatically cleaning up the objects for us.

`shared_ptr` should be used to:
* Represent multiple ownership
* Has reference count
* Has (sometimes significant) overhead compared to unique_ptr.


Therefore we should prefer `unique_ptr`. It's advantages are:
* `unique_ptr` is cheap to create, cheap to manage and cheap to move
* Can easily be converted into shared_ptr when necessary. E.g.

```c++
    std::unique_ptr<Base> factory(bool derived1) {
        if (derived1) {
            return std::make_unique<Derived1>();
        } else {
            return std::make_unique<Derived2>();
        }
    }

    int main() {
        auto p = factory(true); //If we don't know what the user wants yet

        std::shared_ptr<Base> p = factory(true); //User can choose to convert 
                                                 //to a shared pointer and 
                                                 //have a reference counted 
                                                 //copy of it if they need to 
                                                 //while not paying for the 
                                                 //extra overhead of a shared 
                                                 //pointer if they don't need 
                                                 //to
    }
```

We can also do some more advanced things to help manage the lifetime of other resources not just things that are created with `new` and `delete`: 

```c++
// ADVANCED SMART POINTER USAGE
// In this example we using fopen to create a file pointer and are passing to 
// the unique_ptr the destructor we want it to call. So now we can open a file 
// and work with it and be assured that the file will be cleaned up when we 
//  are done with it.
int main() {
    const auto d = [](FILE *f) { fclose(f); }; //lambda for closing file
    const auto filep = 
        unique_ptr<FILE, decltype(d)>(fopen("/my/file", "r"), d);

    //work with filep
}
```

We should be careful with Smart Pointers for Arrays, this is because:
* `std::unique_ptr` has support for proper construction and destruction of array types i.e. the constructor for `unique_ptr` has a specialization if an array is passed to it. So that it calls the proper array deleter.
* `std::shared_ptr` does not (currently).
* In either case it is preferable to use a standard fixed size array or standard vector inside the `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr`.

Also important to remember that a `unique_ptr` is not copyable. Since `unique_ptr` represents single ownership. So the following code will give us an error:

```c++
int main() {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<int>> v;
    auto i = std::make_unique<int>(5);
    v.push_back(i);

    // Code will not compile, since unique_ptr is non-copyable
}
```

We can however fix the error in the possible two ways:

```c++
int main() {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<int>> v;
    auto i = std::make_unique<int>(5);
    v.push_back( std::move(i) ); //first way of fixing error
    // but now what state is i in? And do we risk reusing i later?

    //There is a second way as well. Here we are constructing and passing the 
    //unique_ptr to the vector in the same statement
    v.emplace_back( std::make_unique<int>(5); ); //emplace_back can be more 
                                                 //efficient then pushback 
                                                 //since it constructs objects 
                                                 //in place
}
```

We should also never use `auto_ptr`. This is because:
* It is fundamentally broken
* It was designed before C++11 and move semantics
* Steals ownership from copy/assign operators of existing auto_ptr
* It's been deprecated

We should try to use smart pointers:
*  Smart pointers are very versatile, know their interfaces
*  ... but prefer the simple interface
*  Prefer `std::unique_ptr` over `std::shared_ptr`
*  Prefer `std::make_unique` and `std::make_shared`
*  never use `std::auto_ptr`
*  Use the tools available: clang tidy

## IN VIDEO: Use std::weak_ptr to break cycles of ownership (R.24 in CppCoreGuidelines)

In the following example we have an ownership cycle because the child points ton the parent which points to the children. Even though all objects pop from the stack the reference count of the shared_ptr does not go to 0, and the objects are never destroyed.

```c++
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

struct Node : std::enable_shared_from_this<Node> {
  std::shared_ptr<Node> parent;
  std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Node>> children;
  void addChild(const std::shared_ptr<Node> &c) {
    children.push_back(c);
    c->parent = this->shared_from_this();
  }
};

int main() {
  auto node = std::make_shared<Node>();
  node->addChild(std::make_shared<Node>());
}
```

So the solution is to use a weak_ptr to point back to the parent. So we have a weak reference. So now the parent node can be destroyed nothing is any longer pointing to it. E.G.:

```c++
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

struct Node : std::enable_shared_from_this<Node> {
  std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Node>> children;
  void addChild(const std::shared_ptr<Node> &c) {
    children.push_back(c);
    c->m_parent = this->shared_from_this();
  }

  std::shared_ptr<Node> parent()
  {
    auto p = m_parent.lock(); //check parent that is returned is valid

    if (p) {
      return p;
    } else {
      m_parent.reset(); //reset the weak_ptr
//      throw std::runtime_error("no parent");
    }
  }

  private:
    std::weak_ptr<Node> m_parent;
};

int main() {
  auto node = std::make_shared<Node>();
  node->addChild(std::make_shared<Node>());
}
```

Therefore it is important that we:
* Watch for cycles with std::shared_ptr usage
* Use std::weak_ptr to break cycles
* Use the tools available: address sanitizer
